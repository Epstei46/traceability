I did not pass Step 1 on this exercise.

I was able to complete the demo along with the instructor, but did not understand how to do this exercise starting with an empty folder. Almost the entire class had this issue when we met at the end of the day, and I do not believe it was cleared up.

I was able to modify this past project to function properly when hosted locally OR deployment page from Heroku, but I did not have time to try linking my Rollbar account to my repo and test on the Heroku deployment page.
